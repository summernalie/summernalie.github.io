        <p>Me Before You, is a movie based on a novel of the same name, by author Jojo Meyers. Those who have read the book before, probably knew what they are getting into with the movie. I, on the other hand, hadn't had any encounter with the story beforehand, so I went into it with only whatever the trailer had revealed. I won't give away any spoilers, other than to say the movie is well worth a couple of hours of your time.</p>

        <p>The movie follows the story of Louisa Clark, a quirky and essentially optimistic individual, as she struggles to find a stable job to provide for her family. She finally manages to secure a job, taking care of Will Traynor, a man almost entirely physically paralyzed after a tragic accident. If that sounds like the beginnings of a dark and dreary story, fret not. Despite dealing with heavy and serious subject matter, Me Before You delivers its tale with quintessential warmth and light-heartedness. That's not to say that it makes light of the heavy themes that it presents, but all in all, it maintains an approachable and accessible take on the story, that won't leave you feeling emotionally or psychologically drained by the end. </p>

        <p>While most romantic-comedy type movies nowadays fail to capture any real magic or spark in their story-telling, this movie succeeds in keeping you smiling even when it's delivering deep emotional content. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and it's not overly soppy in its romance either. It just delivers a stirring and charming story of two individuals who change each others' lives. </p>

        <p>Emilia Clarke absolutely shines as Lou, with a silly and quirky approach to life. Her borderline ridiculous fashion, just endears us to her even more, as we see that she doesn't let the seriousness of the world cloud her sunny outlook on life. Her smile is absolutely contagious, and she gives an extremely expressive and likeable performance throughout the movie. It would have been easy for Lou's character to go over the line of being annoying, but Emilia Clarke maintains the right balance in her performance to keep us engaged and rooting for her. If you've only ever seen her as Dany Targaryen, then prepare to see her in a whole new light.</p>

        <p>Sam Claflin has been steadily delivering great performance in popular movies, and this is no different. He manages to be stoic, impassive and difficult, while still showing glimpses of charm and warmth under a cold exterior. Too much to either extreme, would have played as either an exaggeration, or as unrealistic, but Sam Claflin does a good job of keeping us thoroughly invested in Will Traynor.</p>

        <p>The supporting cast is great as well, with standout performances by Matthew Lewis (hello Neville Longbottom, you've certainly changed), as the Lou's ridiculous boyfriend, and Charles Dance (hello, Tywin Lannister, I don't think we've ever seen you smile before), as Will's father. </p>


        <p>There are deep and difficult questions raised by this movie, and it will probably leave these questions with you long after the film is over. But the thing is, along with pondering the tough nuances of life, it will also leave you with a sense of adventure and hope. By the end, there's one true message: Live your life to its fullest potential, and cease opportunities while you can. It's a great movie, and I definitely recommend it.</p>
