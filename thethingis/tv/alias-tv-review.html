                    <p>Coming out of an era where most mainstream TV shows in the Action genre were driven by a male-lead, Alias stood out. Its main protagonist was a 20-something girl, who at first glance looked like the quintessential girl-next-door, complete with cute dimples, girly voice and bubbling personality.</p> 
                    <p>But as we were introduced to Sydney Bristow in the Pilot episode, it was evident that this girl could kick your ass. And she could do it with a bullet in her shoulder and with several of her teeth having just been pulled. She could take down an bevy of bad guys while rocking <span class="red">electric red hair</span> and running mascara, and still look damn good doing it. And she could switch from a frightened girl trying to gain sympathy from her enemies, to a resilient and calculating secret-agent taunting her captors to <span class="red">"start at the back"</span> as they proceed to torture her for information by pulling her teeth out.</p>

            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <p>Alias followed the story of Sydney Bristow, a CIA agent who must navigate the tumultuous arena of espionage, while trying to maintain some semblance of a life. She turns agent, double agent and triple agent throughout the course of the show; suffers betrayal many times over by those she trusts the most; and along the way loses many of her loved ones as a result of her dangerous occupation. Mixed up in all of this were themes of international intrigue, loyalty, relationships, family, mythical prophecies, ancient technologies, doomsday events, and everything in between. Somehow, Alias managed to integrate a wide variety of genres into a single show, blurring the lines between action, drama, romance and during the latter seasons, even science fiction. It also explored the complex relationship between Sydney and her father, and the story arc of how they begin the series and where they end up is truly remarkable.
</p>
            <p>The series became iconic for Sydney's various disguises on each of her missions. Each episode would feature Jennifer Garner embodying a completely different persona, down to speaking foreign languages, wearing an assortment of crazy outfits and having outrageous hairstyles.</p>
            <p>The show kind of hit its peak around the 3rd and 4th season, and began to gradually decline in terms of coherency and realistic storytelling. That seems to be a pattern with JJ Abrams' shows, where his plots get a little too twisty for their own good. But for what it was, Alias was ever entertaining and never boring.
